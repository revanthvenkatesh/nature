        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

          Nature hacks are when people try to change nature to their will. For decades, humans have modeled technology on observations of the natural world. But new discoveries about nature—and tools for manipulating it—have opened up novel approaches potentially more powerful than mere imitation to solving Human Age problems.

        <h2>Air</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Air, mixture of gases comprising the Earth’s atmosphere. The mixture contains a group of gases of nearly constant concentrations and a group with concentrations that are variable in both space and time.Air is the general name for the mixture of gases that makes up the Earth's atmosphere. This gas is primarily nitrogen (78%), mixed with oxygen (21%), water vapor (variable), argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%), and trace gases. Pure air has no discernible scent and no color. The primary component of air is nitrogen gas.</li>
          <li>Nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, argon, and carbon dioxide account for about 99% of the composition of air.</li>
          <li>Trace gases include neon, methane, helium, krypton, hydrogen, xenon, ozone, and many other elements and compounds.</li>
          <li>The composition of air varies from one place to the next and even varies depending on whether it is day or night.</li>
          <li>Nitrogen, oxygen and argon are the three main components of the atmosphere. Water concentration varies, but averages around 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. Carbon dioxide and all of the other elements and compounds are trace gases. Trace gases include the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Except for argon, other noble gases are trace elements. These include neon, helium, krypton, and xenon. Industrial pollutants include chlorine and its compounds, fluorine and its compounds, elemental mercury vapor, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. Other components of the atmosphere include spores, pollen, volcanic ash, and salt from sea spray.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Air in relation with nature hacks</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            One thing of nature which gets hacked often is air. Anexcellent way to reduce pollution inside your house is to make sure it is adequately ventilated. Bring in fresh air from outside to dilute indoor pollutants and improve the air circulation throughout all parts of your home. If you don’t want to bring in the outdoor temperatures with the air, an energy recovery ventilator (ERV) is your best solution. Improving ventilation also reduces the need for air conditioning. This is important because air conditioning is bad for the environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhance your indoor air quality by consistently cleaning your home. A good cleaning removes a lot of the allergens and pollutants. When choosing cleaning solutions, avoid products containing harmful chemicals, which contribute to decreased air quality. Use natural cleansers made without harmful chemicals.
Vacuum your floor, especially in high traffic areas. Don’t forget to clean upholstered furniture, where dust can accumulate. Make sure you wash your vacuum’s filter regularly. Mop hardwood, tile, and vinyl floors to capture the dust that the vacuum can’t remove. Using a microfiber material is the best option to attract and eliminate small dirt particles. Don’t forget to clean the baseboards, window coverings and walls.
Use doormats inside and outside of your house at entryways. Many chemicals, dirt, and pollutants stay trapped under people’s shoes and by using a doormat at commonly used doorways, potentially harmful elements will not make their way to the inside of your home.
          </li>
          <li>Not only do plants add life and color to your home, but some of them can also remove indoor pollutants. According to NASA’s Clean Air study, some plants can remove dangerous pollutants like formaldehyde, radon, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, and pesticides from the air.</li>
          <li>Examples of air-cleaning plants include philodendron, the Dwarf or Pygmy palm, and peace lilies. These are easy and undemanding plants that don’t need much watering, so you won’t have to worry too much about their maintenance.
            Your HVAC provides fresh air and can efficiently remove allergens and germs. A regular inspection is required to allow your system to work efficiently. Therefore, you must look for high-quality specialists like Triangle Heating & Cooling. These service experts will inspect and clean your HVAC system, change the filters, and improve your indoor air quality.</li>
          <li>Regularly scheduled HVAC maintenance ensures excellent air quality for your family in any season. Many providers offer a maintenance plan, which makes it easy for homeowners to stay on track with maintenance appointments.
            An air cleaner or purifier does more than a basic HVAC filter. It works with your entire system to capture bacteria and airborne allergens, and can even destroy common cold viruses.</li>
          <li>Also, an air conditioning system helps in changing the temperature and speed of air to suitable conditions.</li>
         </ul>

        <h3>Air pollution</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            While air is mostly gas, it also holds lots of tiny particles. These particles in the air are called aerosols. Some aerosols—like dust and pollen—are picked up naturally when the wind blows. But the air can also carry soot, smoke, and other particles from car exhaust and power plants. These are major contributors to air pollution.           </li>
          <li>
            People need to breathe, and so do lots of other animals—and plants! Breathing is part of a process called respiration. During respiration, a living thing takes in oxygen from the air and gives out carbon dioxide. This process gives animals and plants the energy to eat, grow, and live life! When humans and animals breathe, we give off an odorless gas called carbon dioxide, or CO2. Plants use this gas, along with sunlight, to make food—and oxygen too! This process is called photosynthesis. However, large amounts of CO2 are produced when cars and power plants burn coal, oil, and gasoline. This is bad because CO2 is the most important contributor to human-caused global warming.

          <li>Air also holds water.   When humans and animals breathe, we give off an odorless gas called carbon dioxide, or CO2. Plants use this gas, along with sunlight, to make food—and oxygen too! This process is called photosynthesis. However, large amounts of CO2 are produced when cars and power plants burn coal, oil, and gasoline. This is bad because CO2 is the most important contributor to human-caused global warming.</li>
          <li>Air acts as insulation, keeping the earth from getting too cold or too hot. Ozone another type of gas protects us from sunlight.  Air in the atmosphere can also protect us from meteoroids.</li>
          <li> Air pollution is measured with the Air Quality Index or AQI. The lower the AQI, the cleaner the air is. However, if you are outside when the AQI is over 100, it’s about the same as breathing in exhaust from a car all day! Things that cause poor air quality are forest fires and cities with lots of car traffic. If the AQI is higher than 100 you shouldn’t spend too much time outside.</li>
         </ul>

          <li>
            <b>Why is air called a mixture of gasses ?</b>  
          </li>
          <li>
             Air is a mixture of gasses because
                Air can be separated into its constituents such as oxygen, nitrogen etc. by fractional distillation of liquid air.
                Air shows the properties of all the gases present in it. For Example: Air supports combustion because of oxygen present in the air.
                Air has a variable composition because at different places the different amount of gases are present in the air.
              
          </li>
          <br></br>

          <li>
            <b>What is air pollution ?</b>  
          </li>
          <li>
            Air pollutants can be emitted directly from a source or can form from chemical reactions in the atmosphere. When concentrations of these substances reach critical levels in the air, they harm humans, animals, plants and ecosystems, reduce visibility and corrode materials, buildings and cultural heritage sites.   
          </li>
